Potbelly tries to take some of the creativity out of it by giving you a limited selection of your meat and cheese. Your creativity comes into play after the sandwich has been toasted. This is where condiments can be added. The only thing that is mandatory is Potbelly&rsquo;s own hot peppers. These hot peppers are amazing. It is a mixture of 5 or 6 different peppers and olives marinated in oil. One or two spoonfulls added to any sandwich makes it much much better. There is also the option to add other condiments like: ranch, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, oil, and italian seasoning. They also provide the option to ruin the sandwich with mayo but usually only kids take that route. It is hard to not create a great sandwich with the options that Potbelly gives you.</h4>

<h2 id="its-better-than-subway-for-the-same-price">Its better than Subway for the same price</h2>

<p>####Subway brainwashed a lot of people with their &ldquo;5 dollar footlong&rdquo; jingle. Even if those sandwiches never were 5 dollars or a footlong they hardly hold a candle next to a Potbelly Sandwich. Potbelly sandwiches are a little bit more expensive, probably a dollar or less more. The difference in price is completely worth it because the difference in quality is so great.

<h3 id="be-warned-eating-a-potbelly-sandwich-will-ruin-subway-for-you">Be Warned! Eating a Potbelly Sandwich Will Ruin Subway For you!</h3>

<p>####I had Potbelly once and it is was good, but it still doesn&rsquo;t beat Subway in my opinion. Just the smell of the fresh bread walking into Subway is a plus.</p>
